                    Picture yourself standing in the red dust in a space suit, millions of miles away from Earth,
                    looking up at the stars knowing that somewhere up there is your home-planet. There is a lot of
                    research going on at this exact moment. Scientists are working to find solutions to how we can make
                    it happen – and send the first human to land on Mars.

                    Apart from the amazing adventure itself, human life on Mars would give us progress in several areas.
                    Some of them are solar energy, food production, recycling and medical technology. Scientists do not
                    expect to find current life on Mars, but they are looking for signs of a past life.

                    You're thinking the same as us, right? Why would we go to Mars, and not to another planet? Well,
                    scientists have the answer. After the Earth, Mars is the most habitable planet in our solar system
                    due to several reasons:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Its soil contains water to extract</li>
                        <li>It isn’t too cold or too hot</li>
                        <li>There is enough sunlight to use solar panels</li>
                        <li>Gravity on Mars is 38% that of our Earth’s, which is believed by many to be sufficient for
                            the human body to adapt to.</li>
                        <li>It has an atmosphere (albeit a thin one) that offers protection from cosmic and the Sun’s
                            radiation</li>
                        <li>The day/night rhythm is very similar to ours here on Earth: a Mars day is 24 hours, 39
                            minutes and 35 seconds</li>
                    </ul>

                <blockquote cite="https://www.mars-one.com/faq/mission-to-mars/is-it-safe-to-live-on-mars">
                    Living on Mars cannot be considered entirely risk-free, in particular during the first few years.
                    There are a number of elements that could pose a problem:
                    <ul>
                        <li>An essential component of the settlement could be affected</li>
                        <li>There is a chance that an astronaut might not survive if his or her Mars Suit were to become
                            seriously damaged during a mission outside of the habitat</li>
                        <li>Certain medical conditions are not treatable on Mars</li>
                    </ul>

                        alt="a conceptual image of a Mars settlement with two astronauts in space suits standing in the front, with space settlement in the background.">
                    Living on Mars is comparable to getting by on i.e. Antarctica, and provides similar challenges.
                    However, the South Pole now has a number of very advanced, large research stations that boast a
                    great deal of modern facilities that provide a good quality of life. On Mars this development still
                    has to be kick started.
